# Blind-signal-processing-3-kinds
# Spectrum data description

Two types of data are provided:
 Â 
+ Real data
+ Simulation data

## Real data

Real data is divided into "short" and "satellite" two parts.

Each folder contains a number of spectrum data, the format is:
The following are the same as the "
Xx_FSyy_FFTzz_FULL.spec
Xx_FSyy_FFTzz_U ##. Spec

Where xx is the data number, yy is the sampling rate, and zz is the order of the calculated spectrum.

FULL is the broadband spectrum data, and the corresponding U ## spec is the narrowband spectrum data extracted from the wideband.
  
Narrowband spectral data can be used as a sample for learning and training, and broadband spectrum data can be used as input for identification.

## Simulation data

The simulation data is generated by the program to meet the specific modulation mode, sampling rate, symbol rate, singal to noise ratio and other parameters of the simulation signal. The files are stored in a modal folder.

File name in the FS, BW, CN and FFT, etc. identified the signal and the spectrum of the relevant parameters, which FULL end of the broadband spectrum, U # # end of the narrowband spectrum data
